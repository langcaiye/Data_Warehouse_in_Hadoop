# Data Warehouse in Hadoop
I'm really a big fan of Ralph Kimball. However, I have no chance to fully implement the definite Dimensional Modeling in my career. Nowadays, in the environment of big data, such as the Hadoop ecosystem, it seems even more impossible to fully implement Kimball's Dimensional Modeling. However, it is undeniable that Kimball's Dimensional Modeling is still the most definitive guide on constructing the data warehouse. Even more as everytime I'm reading the <Data Warehouse Toolkit>, it can continue to inspire me and give the valuable suggestions.
